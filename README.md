# 🌱 We're currently learning

- [Angular](https://angular.io) - We ❤ this framework, because fast, automation, powerfull, incredible tooling, and we can build apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.
- [Ionic Frameworks](https://ionicframework.com) - We're starting to fall in ❤ with this framework, because it uses Angular. And all components are ready to use.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - The world’s most popular front-end open source toolkit, featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - We learned about it to understand NoSQL and Realtime Database. But for now, we are only using it for temporary data storage.
- [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org) - We ❤ jitsi because it's so easy to learn, whether it's creating your own jitsi server or integrating with applications.
- [Symfony PHP](https://symfony.com) - Symfony is a set of reusable PHP components. For the purposes of the PHP backend, we fall to Symfony or choose to use PHP natively.
- [MQTT](https://mqtt.org) - We learned how to build a MQTT server with several brokers (mosquitto, EMQX, etc). We really like how MQTT works.
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) - Sometimes, you have to try to get into the realm of hardware to have a deeper understanding of how computers work.
- [Dragino](https://www.dragino.com) - We use Dragino as Gateway for all Arduino devices connected using Lora.
